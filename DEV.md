# VPad Tester & Configurator

## Building:

* download [lua player plus](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-vita/releases/)' latest (non-nightly) release
* extract to .\lpp (don't overwrite eboot.bin files unless you want hassle)
* run zBuild.bat

## Dev Miscellany:

* i've modified build.bat to zbuild.bat because i'm lazy
	* use the original if you want to change the name/id
	* you'll have to mess with directories
* [vpk editor](https://qberty.com/ps-vita-vpk-editor/) is quite useful for automatically reducing bit depth
* this is how i visualise stick range
